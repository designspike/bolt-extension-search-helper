Search Helper Extension for Bolt CMS
====================================

Normally, repeater fields aren't searchable with Bolt's built in search function. This extension works around that by dumping all your repeater fields' text values into a field of your choice whenever you save.

**It requires configuration though** - modify the example config file that gets created at extensions/search-helper.designspike.yml for a quick start. You only need to pick your contenttypes, and the destination field for each one.
